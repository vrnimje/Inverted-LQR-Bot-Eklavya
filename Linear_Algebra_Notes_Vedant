#Linear Algebra

##1. Vectors

<p> Defined as ordered list of numbers or,<br>
 Quantity having both magnitude and direction 
 [13,4]=[x,y]
</p>

<p> Scaling of vectors: Multiplying a constant(scalar) with a vector <br>
    2[1,2] = [2,4]
</p>

##2. Linear Combinations, Span and Basis Vectors 

<p> <strong>v</strong> = i + 2j = [1,2], where i and j are unit basis vectors<br>
    Linear combination: a<strong>v</strong> + b<strong>w</strong> <br>
    It basically represents the span of the vectors, when taken as basis vectors<br>
    For 2 vectors: It is a plane    For 3 vectors: It can represent all vectors<br>
    
    Linearly dependent: <strong>u</strong> = a<strong>v</strong> + b<strong>w</strong><br>
    Linearly independent: <strong>u</strong> != a<strong>v</strong> + b<strong>w</strong><br>
    Basis of vector space is a set of Linearly independent vectors that span the full space
