<h1>Linear Algebra</h1>

<h2> 1. Vectors</h2>

<p> Defined as ordered list of numbers or,<br>
 Quantity having both magnitude and direction 
 [13,4]=[x,y]
</p>

<p> Scaling of vectors: Multiplying a constant(scalar) with a vector <br>
    2[1,2] = [2,4]
</p>

<h2> 2. Linear Combinations, Span and Basis Vectors </h2>

<p> **v** = i + 2j = [1,2], where i and j are unit basis vectors<br>
    Linear combination: a**v** + b**w** <br>
    It basically represents the span of the vectors, when taken as basis vectors<br>
    For 2 vectors: It is a plane    For 3 vectors: It can represent all vectors<br>
    Linearly dependent: **u** = a**v** + b**w**<br>
    Linearly independent: **u** != a**v** + b**w**<br>
    Basis of vector space is a set of Linearly independent vectors that span the full space
